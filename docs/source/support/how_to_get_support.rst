GenPipes Support
================

GenPipes is released as open source software and comes with no commercial support (? Or does it, pls check with Rola /GSoD mentors and update accordingly here).

We currently provide community support through our `GitHub project page <https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/genpipes/src/master/>`_. If you encounter an issue or have a question, feel free to reach out via GitHub issues for Mangle

For more general user questions, send us an email.

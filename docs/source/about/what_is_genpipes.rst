What is GenPipes?
=================

GenPipes is an open source, flexible, scalable Python-based framework that facilitates
the development and deployment of multi-step computational workflows. These workflows
are optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and the cloud.

GenPipes offers 12 validated and scalable pipelines for the following genomics applications:

* DNA-Seq
* DNAseq_high_coverage
* RNA-Seq
* De-Novo RNASeq
* ChIP-Seq
* Tumour Analysis
* Hi-C
* Metagenomic
* PacBio assembly

GenPipes Features
-----------------
* Multiple Schedulers
  - GenPipes is optimized for HPC processing. Currently, it supports 4 schedulers - Slurm, PBS/Torque, Batch, Daemon.

* Optimal Job Execution Time
  - GenPipes minimizes overall job analysis time by job dependency model that leverages job parallelism. This enables jobs to become active and executed as soon as the dependencies are met.

* Smart Relaunching of Jobs
  - Through smart tracking of job progress, GenPipes can determine which jobs failed and at which steps. This helps to relaunch the jobs at the exact point in time, just before the last failure, automatically.
  
* Parameter Encapsulation
  - GenPipes is a flexible framework that allows user adjustments. It implements a superposed configuration system to reduce the time required to set-up or modify parameters needed during the analysis.

* Diverse Inputs
  - GenPipes is flexible in terms of multiple choice of input files for the analysis. It allows users to skip specific steps in the pipeline if they consider them unnecessary.

* Customizable Workflows
  - GenPipes limits wastage of expensive HPC resources and time as it allows customizable steps in different pipelines enabling users to plug and play with customized pipeline steps. 

About the documentation
-----------------------

This documentation is continuously written, corrected, edited, and revamped by
members of the GenPipes community. It is edited via text files in the
`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup
language and then compiled into a static website/offline document using the
open source `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs
<https://readthedocs.org/>`_ tools.

The GenPipes project team welcomes contributions from the community. We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as we can.If you wish to contribute code and you have not signed our contributor license agreement (CLA), our bot will update the issue when you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our FAQ.

Before you start to code, we recommend discussing your plans through a Github issue or discuss it first with the official project maintainers via team chat, especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give you feedback on your design, and help you find out if someone else is working on the same thing.

===============================

.. note:: This is a sample doc-set as part of a new initiative to restructure existing documents 
	  for easy onboarding of new users. It is a draft proposal. 
	  Please visit `GenPipes Documentation <http://www.computationalgenomics.ca/genpipes/>`_
	  for official version of this documentation

Welcome to the sample documentation of GenPipes!

GenPipes is a flexible Python-based framework that facilitates the development and deployment of multi-step workflows optimized for High-Performance Computing clusters and the cloud.  It offers open sourced 12 validated and scalable pipelines for various genomics applications.

The table of contents below and in the sidebar should let you easily access the
documentation for your topic of interest. You can also use the search function
in the top left corner.

.. note:: GenPipes is sponsored by Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics (C3G).
          C3G provides bioinformatics analysis and HPC services for the life science
	  research community. It has created a distributed innovation node with broad
          expertise in bioinformatics, providing customized and case-by-case analysis
          services as well as an extensive suite of software solutions for the genomics community. 
          For details, refer to `C3G official website <http://www.computationalgenomics.ca>`_.
